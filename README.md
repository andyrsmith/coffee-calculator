# Coffee Calculator

## Intro

A simple website where you select the your desire coffee ratio and then enter either the amount of coffee in grams or amount of water in ml.  Then it will list either the amount of water or amount of coffee you should add depending on what you enter.

## Why

These already exist but most will contain extra options like how strong you want the coffee or how you are brewing it.  I just wanted a simple form where I could select the desire ratio and the amount of coffee I'm adding.

## How to run

This is just a simple html file so you can open it in any browser or use a local http server like python simple server.
